# This is the OSSOS survey description file.
#
# All lines starting with '#' are ignored, so they are used for comments
#
# Each data line has the format:
# <width> <height> <RA> <DEC> <epoch> <filling_factor> <tracked_fraction> \
#   <obs_code> <efficiency_file_name>
#
# <width>: width of FOV, in degree
# <height>: height of FOV, in degree
# <RA>: Right Ascension of pointing, decimal degree or HH:MM:SS[.ss...]
# <DEC>: Declination of pointing, decimal degree or DD:MM:SS[.ss...]
# <epoch>: epoch of pointing, in Julian day (decimal)
# <filling_factor>: filling factor of that FOV
# <obs_code>: observatory code
# <efficiency_file_name>: name of efficiency file for that pointing
#
# For Megaprime, the 36 CCDs are 2048x4612 with pixels 0.18689x0.18689", so
# assuming a total footprint of 1 sq.deg, the filling factor is 0.9164

# From JJ's e-mail on Dec. 2nd, 2014, there were 7 chips out of 756 that had
# a PSF problem, thus the pipeline did not run to the end. All other cases
# had good trans.jmp files and completed correctly. So effective surface
# area is 749/756 = 99.07%, so filling factor is 0.9907*0.9164=0.9079

#
# From my own work and from JJ's e-mail from Nov. 30th, 2014, there were 9
# chips out of 756 which had bad trans.jmp files. So the effective search area
# was 747/756 = 98.81% of the total area, so the filling factor is
# 0.9881*0.9164 = 0.9055

#
# From checking the vtags of Lblock_redo, only 20 fields were searched, and out
# of the 720 chips, 1 had problems at step2 which propaged to step3 and
# combine. So effective surface area is 719/720 = 99.86% of the total area, so
# filling factor is 0.9986*0.9164 = 0.9151

# 2014B-H block
#
# From checking the vtags of Hblock, I find only 751 chips successful out of
# 756 (my e-mail to JJ from Nov. 30, 2015). In the same time, JJ find only 2
# faulty chips. Until I get an answer from him, I'll stick to my findings.
# So effective surface area is 751/756 = 99.34% of the total area, so
# filling factor is 0.9986*0.9164 = 0.9103

# 2015A-P block
#
# This is the first block for which the mosaic includes the ears, making the
# total surface larger than 1 sq.deg. As a first approximation, I use the same
# filling factor as usual, but the total area of each frame is 40/36 sq.deg.
# Need to account for that when using rectangles or given polygons.
# Area of each frame is 1.11 sq.deg.
# There are 20 frames, so the total area is 20.*1.11 = 22.22 sq.deg.
#
# According to the vtags, 1 out of 800 chips failed, so effective area is
# 799/800 = 0.99875 = 99.875% of the total area, so filling factor becomes
# 0.99875*0.9164 = 0.9153.
#
# Now, there is a chance there is some overlap between the different frames.
# Actually, it's a known fact as some object(s) got observed twice in the
# discovery run. On late February 2016, the overlap was measured to be 0.5554%
# So the filling factor is 0.99875*0.9164/1.005554 = 0.9102
